My name is Jason Locklin, and I’m the Data Science Lead at the Toronto Catholic District School Board. I’m excited to be here today to talk about a project that I believe has significant potential for all of us in Ontario’s education sector. My goal is to give you a technical preview of a self-hosted survey platform called surveydown."

This is a Quarto document!\n\nNote that the syntax for Quarto is only slightly changed from Rmarkdown and it’s easy to convert documents. Quarto can produce all sorts of document types, and can be used for general writing as well as literate programming of analyses.\nYou may have used knitr in R to produce RMarkdown notebooks. Quarto is a stand-alone replacement that can run independently of R.\nThese documents, however, are not interactive on their own."

For those who haven’t used it, Shiny is a powerful package from Posit that allows us to build interactive web applications without leaving the R environment we’re comfortable with. It’s what takes our data analysis and turns it into a tool that others can use, and it’s the magic that will power our live surveys."

It’s the specialized tool that connects the document-writing world of Quarto with the interactive world of Shiny.

They want to create a tool that is not only easy to use for R practitioners but also performant enough for real-world data collection. They emphasize flexibility, showing off advanced use cases, and most importantly, it’s a completely open-source project, which aligns perfectly with the needs of the public sector.\n\nEase of Use: Make survey creation in R simple and intuitive.\nPerformance: Ensure surveys are fast and can handle many concurrent users (with the right hosting).\nFlexibility: Allow for everything from simple questionnaires to complex, dynamic designs like conjoint analysis.\nOpen Source: Provide a free, transparent, and community-driven alternative to proprietary platforms that can be run on your own infrastructure."

The reasons are compelling for us in school boards. It’s about data sovereignty and security—keeping our sensitive data on our own servers. It’s about significant cost savings over commercial platforms. And it’s about control—the freedom to customize our tools and avoid being locked into a specific vendor’s ecosystem.\n\nData Governance & Sovereignty: Keep student and staff data on your own infrastructure, under your control.\nCost Savings: Avoid annual subscription fees for survey platforms.\nCustomization & Collaboration: Full control over the survey’s functionality and appearance as shareable R source.\nNo Vendor Lock-in: Freedom to adapt and evolve your tools as your needs change."

This diagram shows the workflow. It all starts with a single Quarto file. In this file, you’ll write standard Markdown for your text and instructions, and then you’ll add R code chunks where you define your questions using the sd_question function. Once you’re done, surveydown processes this file and automatically generates a fully functional Shiny web application."

The biggest barrier is often the technical complexity of setting up servers. My project uses a technology called Docker to simplify this. The best analogy for Docker is a shipping container. It bundles up an application, like our Shiny Server, with all its dependencies—the correct version of R, all the R packages, everything—into a single, isolated box. This box will run identically wherever you put it, which makes deployment incredibly reliable."
